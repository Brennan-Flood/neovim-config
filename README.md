TODO update readme to reflect some info on how to use all plugins so I don't confuse myself in the future :)

This is my nvim conf

I have the following plugins installed currently:

Barbar is a modern tab bar ui to swap between buffers

| `<Shift-Tab>`             | Previous buffer        |
| `<Leader>1` → `<Leader>9` | Go to buffer 1–9       |
